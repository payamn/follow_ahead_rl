This is the git repo for LBGP: Learning Based Goal Planning for Autonomous Following in Front.
We created a docker for this project that can be used for any gazebo gym project.
First follow this tutorial to install docker with GPU:
```
https://cnvrg.io/how-to-setup-docker-and-nvidia-docker-2-0-on-ubuntu-18-04/
```

Then first run "bash docker/run_script.bash"
If you want to run this docker again you can use "bash docker/exec_script.bash"

To Run without docker:
```
Install ROS Melodic with Gazebo 9.16
```
test:
```
gazebo --version

```
Now create catkin_ws and get multi_jackal
You need to check and install the requirements of https://github.com/NicksSimulationsROS/multi_jackal
```
sudo apt install python-catkin-tools 
cd ~/
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/payamn/follow_ahead_rl.git
git clone https://github.com/NicksSimulationsROS/multi_jackal 
cd ..
catkin build
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/follow_ahead_rl/
pip install gym-gazeboros
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/catkin_ws/src/follow_ahead_rl/gym-gazeboros" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
